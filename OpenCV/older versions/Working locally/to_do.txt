Model works locally however need to add the following:
	
	1. Import model to streamlit
	2. Wrap streamlit with flask to record key presses as events if possible
	3. Make sure to fix IndexOutOfBoundsError on option when option is selected
	4. Model needs to run faster, possilby with threads?
	5. Implement all language translation, not just hardcoded to one that it is now.
	6. When using the files, need to add modelResent10.pth too big for github, find workaround
